\section{Concluding remarks} \label{sec:conclude}

This tutorial paper delineates the process of integrating RV within existing AS, by demonstrating different integration patterns through five use cases.
Although the tool integrations has been demonstrated using NuRV and TeSSLa within a DT context utilizing DTaaS, the underlying concepts extend beyond these implementation details.
Consequently, the learning outcomes can be generalized, enabling tutorial participants to apply RV tools in their research to provide stronger guarantees of the correctness of their AS.
In the physical tutorial conducted at ACSOS 2024, the examples will be demonstrated sequentially, with a discussion of the deployment advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Participants will also have the opportunity to run the examples directly on the DTaaS platform.
