  abstract = {In the realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Digital Twins (DTs) have revolutionized the management of physical entities. However, existing implementations often face constraints due to hardware-centric approaches and limited flexibility. This article introduces a transformative paradigm that harnesses the potential of distributed digital twins as proxies, enabling software-centricity and unlocking composability and flexibility for purpose-oriented digital twin development and deployment. The proposed microservices-based architecture, rooted in service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices principles, emphasizes reusability, modularity, and scalability. Leveraging the Lean Digital Twin Methodology and packaged business capabilities expedites digital twin creation and deployment, facilitating dynamic responses to evolving industrial demands. This architecture segments the industrial realm into physical and virtual spaces, where core components are responsible for digital twin management, deployment, and secure interactions. By abstracting and virtualizing physical entities into individual digital twins, this approach lays the groundwork for purpose-oriented composite digital twin creation. Our key contributions involve a comprehensive exposition of the architecture, a practical proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation, and the application of the architecture in a use-case scenario. Additionally, we provide an analysis, including a quantitative evaluation of the proxy aspect and a qualitative comparison with traditional approaches. This assessment emphasizes key properties such as reusability, modularity, abstraction, discoverability, and security, transcending the limitations of contemporary industrial systems and enabling agile, adaptable digital proxies to meet modern industrial demands.},

  abstract  = {The performance and reliability of Cyber-Physical Systems are increasingly aided through the use of digital twins, which mirror the static and dynamic behaviour of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) in software. Digital twins enable the development of self-adaptive CPSs which reconfigure their behaviour in response to novel environments. It is crucial that these self-adaptations are formally verified at runtime, to avoid expensive re-certification of the reconfigured CPS. In this paper, we demonstrate formally verified self-adaptation in a digital twinning system, by constructing a non-deterministic model which captures the uncertainties in the system behaviour after a self-adaptation. We use Signal Temporal Logic to specify the safety requirements the system must satisfy after reconfiguration and employ formal methods based on verified monitoring over Flow* flowpipes to check these properties at runtime. This gives us a framework to predictively detect and mitigate unsafe self-adaptations before they can lead to unsafe states in the physical system.},

Ready availability of reusable models, data and tool assets, can help with creation and use of digital twins. A number of digital twin frameworks exist to facilitate creation and use of digital twins. In this paper we propose a digital twin framework to author digital twin assets, create digital twins from reusable assets and make the digital twins available as a service to other users. The proposed framework automates the management of reusable assets, storage, provision of compute infrastructure, communication and monitoring tasks. The users operate at the level of digital twins and delegate the rest of the work to the digital twin as a service framework.},

  abstract  = {Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based sys- tems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is imple- mented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle},

  abstract = {Monitoring the state of currently running processes and reacting to ad-hoc situations during runtime is a key challenge in Business Process Management (BPM). This is especially the case in cyber-physical environments that are characterized by high context sensitivity. MAPE-K control loops are widely used for self-management in these environments and describe four phases for approaching this challenge: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute. In this paper, we present an architectural solution as well as implementation proposals for using MAPE-K control loops for adaptive workflow management in smart factories. We use Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques and the process execution states of a Workflow Management System (WfMS) in the monitoring phase. In addition, we apply automated planning techniques to resolve detected exceptional situations and to continue process execution. The experimental evaluation with a physical smart factory shows the potential of the developed approach that is able to detect failures by using IoT sensor data and to resolve them autonomously in near real time with considerable results.},

  abstract = {The intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential elements when it comes to the protection of an ICT infrastructure. A misuse IDS is a stable method that can achieve high attack detection rates (ADR) while keeping false alarm rates under acceptable levels. However, the misuse IDSs suffer from the lack of agility, as they are unqualified to adapt to new and ‚Äúunknown‚Äù environments. That is, such an IDS puts the security administrator into an intensive engineering task for keeping the IDS up-to-date every time it faces efficiency drops. Considering the extended size of modern networks and the complexity of big network traffic data, the problem exceeds the substantial limits of human managing capabilities. In this regard, we propose a novel methodology which combines the benefits of self-taught learning and MAPE-K frameworks to deliver a scalable, self-adaptive, and autonomous misuse IDS. Our methodology enables the misuse IDS to sustain high ADR, even if it is imposed on consecutive and drastic environmental changes. Through the utilization of deep-learning based methods, the IDS is able to grasp an attack's nature based on the generalized feature reconstructions stemming directly from the unknown environment and its unlabeled data. The experimental results reveal that our methodology can breathe new life into the IDS without the constant need for manually refreshing its training set. We evaluate our proposal under several classification metrics and demonstrate that the ADR of the IDS increases up to 73.37% in critical situations where a statically trained IDS is rendered totally ineffective.},

  abstract   = {Security certification establishes that a given system satisfies properties and constraints as specified in the system security profile. Mechanisms and techniques have been developed to assess if and how well the system complies with the properties, thereby providing a degree of confidence in the security certification. Generally, certification of security controls defined by NIST SP800-53 is performed at design time to provide confidence in a system's trustworthiness to achieve the organization's mission and business requirements. Assuring confidence in a self-adaptive system's security profile is challenging when both functional and security conditions may change at run time. Static security solutions are insufficient, given that dynamic application of defense mechanisms often needs to dynamically adapt security functionality at run time as part of self-protection. This security adaptation may hinder maintaining functional constraints or vice versa. In addition, adaptation capabilities may give rise to the need for dynamic certification, which can be a difficult procedure given the complexity of the security dependencies. Confidence in an information system's compliance with security constraints can be expressed using security assurance cases (SACs). NIST security controls are defined with a hierarchical structure that makes them amenable to being specified in terms of SACs. A collection of SACs for related security controls form a network that can be used to measure the confidence of security compliance through certification-based evidence. Once the system is deployed, environmental and functional uncertainties may require the coordination of functional and security adaptations. This paper introduces the MAPE-SAC, a security-focused feedback control loop, and its interaction with a MAPE-K, function and performance-focused control loop, to dynamically manage run-time adaptations in response to changes in functional and security conditions. We illustrate the use of both control loops and their interaction with an example of two independent systems that need to cooperate to facilitate autonomous search and rescue in the aftermath of a natural disaster.},
