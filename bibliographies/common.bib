@inproceedings{Wright2022,
  abstract  = {The performance and reliability of Cyber-Physical Systems are increasingly aided through the use of digital twins, which mirror the static and dynamic behaviour of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) in software. Digital twins enable the development of self-adaptive CPSs which reconfigure their behaviour in response to novel environments. It is crucial that these self-adaptations are formally verified at runtime, to avoid expensive re-certification of the reconfigured CPS. In this paper, we demonstrate formally verified self-adaptation in a digital twinning system, by constructing a non-deterministic model which captures the uncertainties in the system behaviour after a self-adaptation. We use Signal Temporal Logic to specify the safety requirements the system must satisfy after reconfiguration and employ formal methods based on verified monitoring over Flow* flowpipes to check these properties at runtime. This gives us a framework to predictively detect and mitigate unsafe self-adaptations before they can lead to unsafe states in the physical system.},

Ready availability of reusable models, data and tool assets, can help with creation and use of digital twins. A number of digital twin frameworks exist to facilitate creation and use of digital twins. In this paper we propose a digital twin framework to author digital twin assets, create digital twins from reusable assets and make the digital twins available as a service to other users. The proposed framework automates the management of reusable assets, storage, provision of compute infrastructure, communication and monitoring tasks. The users operate at the level of digital twins and delegate the rest of the work to the digital twin as a service framework.},
